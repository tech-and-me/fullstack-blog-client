# Important Message - Please Read - Update
The back end of this app was originally deployed on Heroku, but since Heroku no longer offers a free tier, it has disrupted our deployment link. Rest assured, I will deploy it on another alternative platform when I have the time. Please stay tuned for further updates!

In the meantime, please note that the codes for both the front end and back end are still up and working okay locally.

Thank you for your understanding!


# Introdution
This project is a full-stack web application where users are required to sign up to view all posts, create posts, add comments, delete comments, and like or unlike a post.
Frontend of this web application is built with react.js. I used react-icons as well as react-bootstrap for some styling.

# Database
I used MySQL for database management of this web application. Since MySQL is not a cloud-based database, to make this app work perfectly fine anywhere in the world, I have connected MySQL Database with ClearDB Database with the help of the Heroku Add-on option. 

# Deployment
Front-end of this app is deployed on Netlify
The back end of this app is deployed on Heroku. 

# Future improvement
I am planning on adding a few more functions to this app to allow the user to edit their posts as well as update passwords. 
Another importing feature that I want to add is to not allow duplicate usernames to sign up. 
And of course, the most obvious part that needed to be improved is the UI. I'm aware that it doesn't look great at the moment but I will update it soon :)



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single-build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
